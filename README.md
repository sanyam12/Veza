<b> Future Scope : </b>

We hereby seek for further improvements in this app by adding some more interesting features like web scraping. By providing a option of official tab for NITJ, you can register with your official email id (@nitj.ac.in) and can interact with your friends about your non academical doubts. We also aim to create a  personal profile page of every user which will showcase his abouts so that you can follow your favourite college seniors and will be able to personally message them. We also look forward to create a like, dislike and comment system for the answers provided by seniors  to rank their names on an official leaderboard and providing the top name with cool rewards.
